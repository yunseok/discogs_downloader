Still WIP, just trying to make a bunch of scripts to download music in high quality by using a discogs list

Sources are from Deezer for now but will try to also get music from diverse music torrent trackers.

## Requirements

1. Get Selenium + Chromedriver.exe https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
2. Get OAuth for deezer python api https://developers.deezer.com/api/oauth
